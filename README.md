### About
In this game you have to control the avatar using WASD control key, while dodging blocks falling. Your score is increased when a block reaches the bottom.

### Tech I used
Simple game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I also added Animate.css for Avatar Entrance Effect and the Howler.js for Web audio Api for Background Music

#### Bugs
i found out that some developers says it's a bad practice if you will implement audio auto loop, "it's recommended that you have controls, even if itâ€™s just a simple mute/unmute button."

### Features
This game is 100% responsive to any screen size, so dont worry about the screen size of your device. Also, the code is extremely simple to understand.
